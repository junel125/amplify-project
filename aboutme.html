     <h2>Hello, Iâ€™m June  LumumbaðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>I am the Principal of Amplify Collective, a community of like-minded women in tech, marketing, and video creation dedicated to helping small businesses grow. Through Amplify Collective, we deliver custom CSS and styling, website design, digital marketing,
         and video content creation that help brands look their best and amplify their image..</p>
      <p>With a Diploma in Computer Science from Zetech University and experience as a Data Analyst at Bariki Software, I bring strong technical and analytical skills that complement my creative side. My passions extend into beauty, fashion, and interior design, where I enjoy creating stylish, functional experiences, whether online, in-person, or through my own Airbnb business,
         which reflects my entrepreneurial spirit and eye for design.</p> 
       <p>My journey is also one of independence and determination. I recently immigrated from Kenya to the United States on my own to pursue opportunities in both technology and basketball. Having competed with the University of Nairobi Dynamites, I now continue my athletic career at City College of San Francisco, where I bring the same 
        discipline, teamwork, and resilience to the court that I apply in life and business.</p>  
       <p>At heart, I am a young entrepreneur and innovator who thrives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and sport. Whether itâ€™s helping a small business elevate its brand, designing a beautiful space, or carving out my path 
        in a new country, I am driven by passion, purpose, and the pursuit of excellence.</p>
